LLM Project Overview
In today's data-driven business landscape, leveraging data has become imperative for success. This project will explore the evolution of Language Models (LLMs), tracing the roots of data utilization and technical advancements that led to their innovation.

RNNs
This project discusses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), created because the first neural networks had problems. It explains the different types of RNNs and how they work, especially the encoder-decoder type, which is important for language models. It also talks about how RNNs help in making text.

Transformers and Attention Model
Going beyond RNNs, the project shifts to advanced models in deep learning—the Transformer model. You will learn how Transformers addresses the shortcomings of RNNs with the help of the Attention mechanism. From tokenizers to embeddings, we dissect the critical components of Transformer models. You will learn about the types of tokenizers in-depth and the limitations of each type. Additonally, through illustrative examples, you will explore different transformer architectures, such as encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures.

Large Language Models
This project navigates the spectrum of employing Language Models (LLMs) for generative AI projects. From defining use cases to selecting pre-trained models, it emphasizes fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and human feedback loops to augment model performance. With practical implementations showcasing text generation using GPT-2 and Hugging Face, the project explains popular text-generation techniques like greedy search, beam search, and sampling methods. It then moves on to LLM pre-training, discussing sequence-to-sequence models and autoencoder architectures while offering tips and tricks on when to pre-train LLM models for specific use cases.

Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering techniques involve crafting specific instructions or queries given to the language model to influence its output. This project discusses when to use prompt engineering and the three commonly used techniques of creating the perfect prompt: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inferences. The practical implementation complements the theoretical discussion through an example of Dialogue summarization using the FLAN-T5 model.

Fine-Tuning LLMs
Fine-tuning involves training a pre-trained language model on a specific task or dataset to adapt it for a particular application. The project first discusses the problems with in-context learning methods and then explains how fine-tuning can help. It then talks about a big problem with fine-tuning called catastrophic forgetting. The project explains a solution to this problem called Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT). PEFT focuses on only some parts of the model when fine-tuning, making it use fewer resources. It explains how PEFT works and divides it into three types: selective, parameterization, and additive. The project also discusses a common technique called LoRA and another technique called soft prompts, which adds information to the model. It doesn't just talk about these things in theory but also shows how to do fine-tuning with LoRA in practice.

Retrieval Augmented Generation
Introducing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the project navigates through its fundamentals, including vector databases and knowledge grounding techniques to mitigate LLM hallucinations. Through practical examples like e-commerce chatbots LangChain and Streamlit, the project solution showcases how RAG ensures accurate responses by grounding knowledge in real-world data.

 

LLMs are generating a lot of excitement, and we anticipate this buzz will only grow in the near future. However, we recognize that learning about this technology can seem challenging for beginners and experts alike. That's why our expert has carefully crafted this project, incorporating engaging graphics to present the information in an exciting and accessible manner. So, if you're new to the field or seeking to enhance your existing skills, don't hesitate to jump in – you're in for a rewarding experience!
